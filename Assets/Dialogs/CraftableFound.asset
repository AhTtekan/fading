  - I bet I could make something with this, I'll just need to find more materials..
  - I can bring up the crafting menu by holding 'C' ('Y' on Xbox Controller).
  - Then craft by pressing 'z' ('L3')
  - Change inventory slots with Q and E (or D-pad).
  - (I can only craft with things on the ground though, not my inventory)
  - (Pick up items with 'Enter' ('A'), drop them with 'n' ('b')
